Power-BI-Assignments

This repository contains a collection of Power BI Desktop assignments that demonstrate end-to-end workflows for building interactive dashboards and reports. These assignments cover a variety of Power BI concepts such as data modelling, DAX calculations, slicers, bookmarks, tooltips, maps, and charts.

ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Inside

Assignments in this repo walk through the typical workflow of creating a Power BI project:

Loading Data

Importing datasets from Excel/CSV into Power BI.

Cleaning and shaping data in Power Query.

Data Modelling

Creating relationships between multiple tables.

Using primary/foreign keys and managing cardinality.

Building a logical model for analysis.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

Creating calculated columns (e.g., extracting Year from Date).

Writing measures for aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVERAGE).

Using functions like RELATED(), SELECTEDVALUE(), and IF().

Filtering & Slicers

Adding slicers to filter data dynamically.

Building DAX measures that show values only when a slicer is selected.

Interactive Visuals

Creating charts (column, line, tree map, pie).

Designing maps to visualize location-based data.

Using tooltips for additional context on hover.

Applying bookmarks & buttons for custom navigation.

Reports & Dashboards

Combining visuals into well-structured reports.

Using drill-down & cross-filtering for deeper insights.

Formatting visuals for readability and storytelling.
